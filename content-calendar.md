## 📆 Week 1: LAUNCH WEEK — Awareness

### Day 1 (Monday) — Launch Announcement
**Twitter/X (8 AM):**
🚀 We just launched NextGen School — AI literacy for kids ages 9-13! No coding needed. Just curiosity. Your child can learn to THINK about AI, not just use it. Free trial → nextgenschool.aiupskills.com #AIforKids #NextGenSchool #FutureReady

**Instagram (11 AM):**
🎉 IT'S LIVE! NextGen School is here — and we're on a mission to prepare every child for the AI future. 🤖✨ Our platform teaches kids ages 9-13 to understand AI through hands-on adventures — no coding required! 🧠 AI Adventures — Learn how AI thinks 🚀 Space Explorers — AI meets the cosmos 🔧 Robotics Lab — Build smart machines Start your FREE trial today! Link in bio 👆 #AIforKids #NextGenSchool #MindOverMachines #AILiteracy #EdTech #STEMforKids #FutureReady #ParentingInAI #LaunchDay

**LinkedIn (7 AM):**
I'm proud to announce the launch of NextGen School — an AI literacy platform for children ages 9-13. As parents, my co-founder Sathish and I saw a gap: our kids use AI daily, but schools aren't teaching them to THINK critically about it. 85% of jobs in 2030 will require AI literacy. Only 3% of schools teach it. We built NextGen School to bridge that gap — with visual, drag-and-drop courses that make AI concepts accessible and fun. No coding required. Free trial available at nextgenschool.aiupskills.com #AIforKids #EdTech #AILiteracy #FutureOfEducation

### Day 2 (Tuesday) — The Problem
**Twitter/X (12 PM):**
Your child uses ChatGPT, Siri, and AI filters every day. But can they tell when AI is wrong? 🤔 Critical thinking > blind trust. That's what we teach. #AIforKids #CriticalThinking #NextGenSchool

**Instagram (7 PM):**
⚠️ Here's a scary stat: 73% of kids trust AI answers without questioning them. Think about that. Your child asks AI for homework help — but do they know when the AI is making things up? At NextGen School, we don't just teach kids to USE AI. We teach them to QUESTION it. ❓ That's the difference between being AI-literate and being AI-dependent. Start building critical thinking skills today → Link in bio #AIforKids #CriticalThinking #ParentingInAI #AILiteracy #DigitalLiteracy #MindOverMachines

**LinkedIn (12 PM):**
A concerning trend: children are becoming consumers of AI without understanding how it works. They trust AI-generated answers without verification. They can't distinguish AI-generated content from human-created work. This isn't a future problem — it's happening NOW. At NextGen School, we're teaching 9-13 year olds the critical thinking skills they need to navigate an AI world responsibly. #AILiteracy #EdTech #CriticalThinking

### Day 3 (Wednesday) — Course Spotlight: AI Adventures
**Twitter/X (9 AM):**
🤖 Course Spotlight: AI Adventures! Kids learn how AI "thinks" — pattern recognition, data bias, decision-making. All through visual missions. No code. Just fun. Ages 9-13. Try free → nextgenschool.aiupskills.com #AIforKids #NextGenSchool

**Instagram (12 PM):**
🤖 COURSE SPOTLIGHT: AI Adventures! Ever wondered how AI "thinks"? Your child will find out! In this course, kids explore: ✨ How AI recognizes patterns 🧩 What "training data" really means ⚖️ Why AI can be biased 🎯 How AI makes decisions Every lesson is a visual, hands-on mission. No coding. No boring lectures. Just pure discovery! Perfect for ages 9-13. Free trial → link in bio 🔗 #AIforKids #AIAdventures #NextGenSchool #STEMforKids #EdTech #AIeducation #MindOverMachines

**LinkedIn (5 PM):**
Introducing our flagship course: AI Adventures 🤖 Most AI education jumps straight to coding. We take a different approach. Before children write a single line of code, they need to understand HOW AI thinks: pattern recognition, training data, bias, decision trees. Our AI Adventures course teaches these concepts through visual, interactive missions designed for ages 9-13. The result? Kids who don't just use AI tools — they understand them. nextgenschool.aiupskills.com #AIeducation #EdTech #STEMforKids

### Day 4 (Thursday) — Engagement / Poll
**Twitter/X (5 PM):**
At what age should kids start learning about AI? 🤔 Reply with your answer! (We think 9 is perfect 😉) #AIforKids #ParentingInAI #NextGenSchool

**Instagram (11 AM):**
🗳️ PARENT POLL TIME! At what age did YOUR child first use AI? (Siri, Alexa, ChatGPT, AI filters...) Drop your answer in the comments! 👇 You might be surprised — most kids start using AI by age 6, but don't learn ABOUT it until... well, never. 😬 That's why we built NextGen School. Ages 9-13. AI literacy made fun. #AIforKids #ParentPoll #ParentingInAI #NextGenSchool #MindOverMachines #DigitalParenting

**LinkedIn (8 AM):**
Question for parents and educators: If 85% of jobs in 2030 will require AI literacy, why are only 3% of schools teaching it? I'd love to hear your thoughts on this gap — and what you think the solution looks like. At NextGen School, we're trying to be part of the answer. #AILiteracy #FutureOfWork #EdTech

### Day 5 (Friday) — Course Spotlight: Space Explorers
**Twitter/X (8 AM):**
🚀 Course Spotlight: Space Explorers! AI + Space = the ultimate adventure for curious kids. Explore how NASA uses AI, design missions, and discover the cosmos. Ages 9-13. #AIforKids #SpaceExploration #NextGenSchool

**Instagram (7 PM):**
🚀 COURSE SPOTLIGHT: Space Explorers! What happens when AI meets the final frontier? Your child finds out! In Space Explorers, kids: 🌌 Discover how NASA uses AI 🛸 Design their own space missions 🔭 Analyze real space data 🪐 Explore AI-powered telescopes This course combines two things kids LOVE — space and technology — into one unforgettable learning journey. Ages 9-13 | No coding required | Free trial → link in bio ✨ #SpaceExploration #AIforKids #NextGenSchool #STEMforKids #NASA #SpaceEducation #MindOverMachines #EdTech

**LinkedIn (12 PM):**
Our Space Explorers course isn't just about space — it's about showing children that AI is a TOOL for discovery. When kids see AI helping NASA explore Mars, analyze distant galaxies, and plan missions, they begin to understand AI's real-world impact. That understanding is the foundation of AI literacy. nextgenschool.aiupskills.com/space-explorers #AIeducation #SpaceTech #EdTech #STEM

### Day 6 (Saturday) — Fun Fact / Educational
**Twitter/X (10 AM):**
🧠 Fun AI fact for kids: AI can now compose music, paint pictures, and write stories — but it still can't truly "understand" any of them. Teach your kids the difference! #AIforKids #AILiteracy #FunFact

**Instagram (12 PM):**
🧠 AI FUN FACT! Did you know? AI can beat the world's best chess player... but it doesn't know it's playing a game. 🤯 AI is incredibly powerful at specific tasks, but it doesn't "think" like humans do. Teaching kids this difference is CRUCIAL for AI literacy. When children understand what AI CAN'T do, they stop fearing it and start mastering it. 💪 More fun facts + real learning → NextGen School (link in bio) #AIforKids #AIFacts #NextGenSchool #STEMforKids #MindOverMachines #CriticalThinking #EdTech

**LinkedIn:** REST DAY

### Day 7 (Sunday) — Founder Story
**Twitter/X (10 AM):**
We're Rathish 🇺🇸 and Sathish 🇮🇳 — two dads who built @NextGenSchool because we couldn't find AI education that actually teaches THINKING, not just tools. Our kids deserved better. So we built it. 🧵👇 #AIforKids #FounderStory

**Instagram (11 AM):**
👨‍👧‍👦 MEET THE FOUNDERS Rathish 🇺🇸 (USA) + Sathish 🇮🇳 (India) = Mind Over Machines We're two fathers from different sides of the world with one shared belief: Every child deserves to understand the technology shaping their future. We watched our kids use AI every day without understanding it. We looked for programs that taught AI THINKING — not just coding. We couldn't find any. So we built NextGen School. 🏫 Our mission: Raise the first generation of AI-literate thinkers. Join us → link in bio 💙 #FounderStory #MindOverMachines #NextGenSchool #AIforKids #EdTech #StartupLife #ParentingInAI #TechFounders

**LinkedIn (10 AM):**
The NextGen School story starts with a simple observation: Our children use AI every day, but they don't understand it. I'm Rathish, based in the USA. My co-founder Sathish is in India. Together, we share a mission — building AI literacy for the next generation. We're not teaching kids to code (yet). We're teaching them to THINK. To question. To understand. Because the future doesn't belong to those who can use AI — it belongs to those who understand it. Learn more: nextgenschool.aiupskills.com #FounderStory #AILiteracy #EdTech #StartupJourney
